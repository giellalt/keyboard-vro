## Windows restrictions

Due to limitations in MS' keyboard driver implementation, it is not
possible to make a deadkey that would output the following six letters
(and their uppercase version):

-   b́
-   B́
-   d́
-   D́
-   f́
-   F́
-   h́
-   H́
-   t́
-   T́
-   v́
-   V́

All other accented letters are available via a deadkey just to the left
of the delete key - type the deadkey, then type the letter you want (see
the [layout](layout.html) for details).

For the six letters above you instead do the following:

1.  type your base character, e.g. "v"
2.  type **shift-deadkey** (this produces a combining diacritic "´")
3.  the end result should be the letter "v́"

This limitation **only applies to Windows**. On macOS and Linux the
deadkey should work for all letters.

An alternative typing approach that works the same across all platforms
is to type AltGr + base char to get the accented letter. See the
keyboard layout definition for details of where the letters are located.
